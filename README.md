# virtaul-pet-shelter
Due to issues with my PC, I was unable to go into the original eclipse folder with the correct spelling of "virtual"  So I had to create a new one with a misspelled word and delete the repository.

I went through my Virtualpet app from last week and did an overhaul.  I found the problems once I submitted them.  I maintained my switch statements, I added to my methods.  I created A Map for the Virtual Pet. I ran tests to make sure all of the methods worked and the tick worked. 
I changed the position of the do/while and the loop worked.
